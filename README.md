## Overview

Network Graph Search is an interactive visualization tool for exploring and analyzing complex network data. The application provides powerful search, filtering, and analysis capabilities to help users discover insights within interconnected data structures.

## Features

- Interactive network graph visualization
- Full-text and semantic search capabilities
- Multi-dimensional filtering (by type, geography, source, etc.)
- Node selection and expansion
- Similarity analysis and visualization
- AI-powered content analysis
- Customizable display options

## Development Roadmap: Phased Approach

### Phase 1: Core Functionality & Performance Optimization

**Timeline: Current - Q4 2025**

#### Key Objectives:

1. **Component Restructuring**
   - Break down the large `NetworkGraphApp` component into smaller, focused components
   - Create separate modules for filters, visualization, and analysis panels
   - Implement proper component boundaries to minimize re-renders

2. **Custom Hooks Implementation**
   - Create domain-specific hooks to replace direct store access
   - Develop `useNodeFiltering`, `useNetworkSelection`, and `useAnalysis` hooks
   - Consolidate related selectors to reduce unnecessary re-renders

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Move heavy computations (TF-IDF, similarity) to Web Workers
   - Implement virtualization for large node lists
   - Optimize memoization strategy to prevent redundant calculations
   - Remove or conditionally enable console logging

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features & UX Improvements

**Timeline: Q1 2026 - Q2 2026**

#### Key Objectives:

1. **Advanced Visualization**
   - Implement additional layout algorithms
   - Add node clustering capabilities
   - Develop interactive graph manipulation tools
   - Create animated transitions between graph states

2. **Improved Search & Filtering**
   - Implement advanced semantic search with embeddings
   - Add saved search/filter presets
   - Develop query history and suggestions
   - Create visual filter builder

3. **Enhanced Analysis Tools**
   - Expand AI-powered analysis capabilities
   - Add comparative analysis between node selections
   - Implement network metrics and statistics
   - Create exportable reports and insights

### Phase 3: Enterprise Features & Scalability

**Timeline: Q3 2026 - Q4 2026**

#### Key Objectives:

1. **Data Management**
   - Implement data versioning and history
   - Add collaborative features for team analysis
   - Create data import/export pipelines
   - Develop custom data connectors

2. **Scalability Improvements**
   - Optimize for very large networks (100,000+ nodes)
   - Implement progressive loading and rendering
   - Add server-side processing for complex operations
   - Create caching strategies for frequent operations

3. **Enterprise Integration**
   - Develop authentication and authorization
   - Add team collaboration features
   - Implement audit logging and compliance features
   - Create API for external system integration

## Technical Implementation Details

### Current Architecture

The application uses:
- React with Next.js for the frontend
- Zustand for state management
- Custom TF-IDF implementation for semantic search
- D3.js-based visualization

### Planned Technical Improvements

1. **State Management**
   - Consolidate store selectors with custom hooks
   - Implement more granular state updates
   - Add persistence layer for user preferences

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Web Workers for computation-heavy tasks
   - Virtualized rendering for large datasets
   - Optimized memoization strategies
   - Lazy loading of non-critical components

3. **Code Organization**
   - Feature-based folder structure
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Comprehensive documentation
